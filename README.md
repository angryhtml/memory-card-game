# Memory Card Game 🧠🎮

A fun and interactive **memory card game** built with **React**. In this game, players need to match pairs of identical cards by flipping them over. If the cards match, they remain open; if not, they are turned back over. The goal is to find all matching pairs with the fewest attempts.

This project is still under development, but you can try the demo version.
